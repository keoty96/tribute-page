            Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815. She is considered the
            first female programmer in history for her contribution to the
            analytical machine, devised by Charles Babbage.
          </p>
          <p class="tribute-info">
            Lovelace wrote the first algorithm designed for the machine that the
            mathematician designed but never built. Babbage conceived a machine
            of a mechanical nature, about 10 meters wide and 30 meters long,
            which would be powered by a steam engine.
          </p>
          <p class="tribute-info">
            The machine planned to have a unit for reading punched cards that
            were already in use at the time. There would be three types of cards
            with different functions, among them to store data and perform
            arithmetic operations.
          </p>
          <p class="tribute-info">
            Ada's work was not recognized until John von Neumann and Alan M.
            Turing, fundamental mathematicians in the development of the modern
            digital electronic computer, created the language called Ada. It is
            a general-purpose language whose main characteristics include the
            possibility of performing concurrent programming, handling
            exceptions, defining abstract data types, etc. This language is
            widely used in the aerospace, military, and nuclear industries. Many
            of the programming languages ​​that appeared after Ada have been
            influenced by it, inheriting some of the qualities integrated from
            the beginning in the ingenious development of Jean Ichbiah and his
            collaborators.
          </p>
          <p class="tribute-info">
            At 29 years old Ada Byron became seriously ill forever. After many
            years of suffering he died at age 37 on November 23, 1852. As Ada
            had always asked, her body was buried next to that of her father
            whom she never knew.
          </p>
          <p class="tribute-info">
            In the 1980s, the United States Department of Defense developed a
            programming language in honor of the Countess, which it named ADA.
